### Samantha Andrews (pronouns: she/her) ðŸ‘‹

I'm Samantha, a frontend React/Typescript engineer and product designer. I enjoy building ambitious, purposeful products for the public good.

As an undergrad, I double majored in Communication and Spanish. I supplemented my studies with art and design classes through my university honors department. During my senior year, I made the decision to pursue design as a career and started building a portfolio through freelance work and online human-centered design courses. In 2018, I completed the Fullstack Software Development Bootcamp at Central New Mexico Community College where I fell in love with formal logic and problem solving through coding.

My multidisciplinary education provides a strong foundation for my role as a product designer and front-end developer, where I bridge the gap between user requirements and polished, user-friendly web applications.

My specialties include thoughtful and practical user interface design and frontend development using React and TypeScript. I have a deep understanding of testing libraries and best practices, navigating a monorepo, and building user interface components and libraries that scale to business needs.

What drives me is a desire to consistently deliver value and delight to users. Design and code are my craft. I do my best to come to work each day with a collaborative attitude, a willingness to learn, and a desire to be 1% better than the day before.

I am currently working at the New York Public Library as a front-end software engineer. I am part of a small team working on web applications that allow people of all ages to read books online for free.

In my free time, I enjoy bird watching, writing and making art.
