### Samantha Andrews (pronouns: she/her) ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Samâ€”a visual designer and frontend developer at Descartes Labs, working on building interfaces that bridge the gap between data scientists and their non-programmatic teammates and stakeholders.

I believe in building purposeful products, that constraints are key, and that it is much more fun to blur the lines between design and engineering.

## My Values
* Creative expression
* Courage, vulnerability & authenticity
* Community & collaboration
* Curiosity & openness

## How I work
What drives me is a desire to consistently deliver value and delight to users. I break up big problems into smaller, more actionable tasks and I'm not afraid to ask for help when I get stuck.
