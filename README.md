### Samantha Andrews (pronouns: she/her) ðŸ‘‹

I'm Samantha, a frontend React/Typescript engineer and product designer. I enjoy building ambitious, purposeful products and bridging the gap between design and engineering.

As an undergrad, I went to the University of New Mexico and double majored in Communication and Spanish. I supplemented my studies with art and design classes through my university honors department. During my senior year, I made the decision to pursue design as a career and started building a portfolio through freelance work and online human-centered design courses. In 2018, I completed the Fullstack Software Development Bootcamp at Central New Mexico Community College where I fell in love with formal logic and problem solving through coding.

My multidisciplinary education provides a strong foundation for my role as a product designer and front-end developer, where I bridge the gap between user requirements and polished, user-friendly web applications.

My specialties include thoughtful and practical user interface design, front-end development using React, and project management. Currently learning Golang and Python.

What drives me is a desire to consistently deliver value and delight to users. Alongside product managers, I work diligently to do just enough research to understand the root of a user's problem and design features that provide value incrementally, without incurring an overwhelming amount of technical debt.

Design and code are my craft. I do my best to come to work each day with a collaborative attitude, a willingness to learn, and a desire to be 1% better than the day before.

I am currently working at Descartes Labs as a product designer and software engineer. I am one of two designers/developers working on web applications that allow data scientists to efficiently access, manage, and analyze satellite imagery and vector datasets.

In my free time, I enjoy bird watching, writing, making art and zines, and teaching computer programming to designers at [Designers Who Code](https://designerswhocode.club/)
